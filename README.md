Welcome to my GitHub, all projects are academic and will not be listed here.

My current portfolio is not complete, though you can see more information on the project in my only public repo...

Go to github-portfolio.com 
for a proper presentation on my work. Also see docs for the website, authentication. (vueportfolio, authAPI respectively)

You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
