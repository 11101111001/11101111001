Welcome to my GitHub, there are many private academic projects, but also some interesting public ones. 

My current portfolio contains the academic projects behind auth, so if you'd like to see more email me for credentials!

Go to github-portfolio.com 
for a proper presentation on my work. Also see docs for the website, authentication.
